Joshua, known as Jman, is one of around 10.5 million players who play League of Legends on the game\u2019s competitive ladder. Tragically, the Jman is exceptionally average. He\u2019s found himself amongst 41 percent of his colleagues- in the silver division of the ranked ladder. But, clearly, a mistake has been made. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jman should be, at least, in the diamond tier that houses only the top 3% of players in the region. The reason for the discrepancy is simple. According to Jman: \u201cRiot [the makers of League of Legends] sucks at game design.\u201d Jman, a communications major at a community college with no game design credits to his name, just knows it. &lt;em&gt;He knows it.&lt;/em&gt; Fortunately for him, some of League of Legends brightest stars agree. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In a recent reddit thread, LCS powerhouses and modern day philosophers, Betsy and Dyrus supported a position similar to Jman\u2019s. As Betsy points out, \u201cRiot is losing a lot [due to their game design choices]\u2026\u201d Dyrus, supporting Betsy\u2019s assertions, pointed out \u201che\u2019s right you know.\u201d A comment that stunned and silenced the opposition. The numbers back up the critics of Riot. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most recently Forbes reported that League\u2019s monthly player numbers have plummeted from 27 million per month in 2012 to 67 million per month as of July 2015. In April of 2014, the eSports viewership only reached 70 million. These numbers are a damning indictment of the direction that the game is heading. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s clear then that Riot should start taking heed of the vocal minority. Riot\u2019s continued success, profitability and popularity just cannot be enough to sustain them. Hopefully they take criticisms to heart before it\u2019s too late. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When called for a comment Riot\u2019s lead game designer, Ghostcrawler, responded \u201cOh Jesus Christ,\u201d and promptly hung up the phone. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "title": "Sources say League of Legends, world\u2019s most popular eSport by far, definitely sucks.", "media": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "saved": false, "edited": 1443180251.0, "is_self": true, "author": "CardboardLeague", "report_reasons": null, "link_flair_css_class": null, "secure_media": null, "num_comments": 1340, "id": "3mb4fp", "selftext": "Players of the world\u2019s most popular and successful eSport, League of Legends, are fed up. \u201cThe game just isn\u2019t good anymore,\u201d whimpers a noticeably defeated player, Joshua Durmont, 20, of Green River, Utah. \n\nJoshua\u2019s story is all too common amongst League of Legends players.

According to Jman: \u201cRiot [the makers of League of Legends] sucks at game design.\u201d Jman, a communications major at a community college with no game design credits to his name, just knows it. *He knows it.* Fortunately for him, some of League of Legends brightest stars agree. \n\nIn a recent reddit thread, LCS powerhouses and modern day philosophers, Betsy and Dyrus supported a position similar to Jman\u2019s. As Betsy points out, \u201cRiot is losing a lot [due to their game design choices]\u2026\u201d Dyrus, supporting Betsy\u2019s assertions, pointed out \u201che\u2019s right you know.\u201d A comment that stunned and silenced the opposition. The numbers back up the critics of Riot. \n\nMost recently Forbes reported that League\u2019s monthly player numbers have plummeted from 27 million per month in 2012 to 67 million per month as of July 2015. In April of 2014, the eSports viewership only reached 70 million. These numbers are a damning indictment of the direction that the game is heading. \n\nIt\u2019s clear then that Riot should start taking heed of the vocal minority. Riot\u2019s continued success, profitability and popularity just cannot be enough to sustain them. Hopefully they take criticisms to heart before it\u2019s too late. \n\nWhen called for a comment Riot\u2019s lead game designer, Ghostcrawler, responded \u201cOh Jesus Christ,\u201d and promptly hung up the phone. \n\n\n", "ups": 3148, "mod_reports": [], "user_reports": [], "archived": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3mb4fp/sources_say_league_of_legends_worlds_most_popular/", "hide_score": false, "author_flair_text": null, "from_kind": null, "from": null, "from_id": null, "distinguished": null, "visited": false, "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "num_reports": null, "thumbnail": "self", "media_embed": {}, "hidden": false, "stickied": false, "permalink": "/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3mb4fp/sources_say_league_of_legends_worlds_most_popular/", "removal_reason": null, "downs": 0, "likes": null, "created_utc": 1443165183.0, "secure_media_embed": {}}, "kind": "t3"}, {"data": {"banned_by": null, "clicked": false, "over_18": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2rfxx", "approved_by": null, "link_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "domain": "youtube.com", "created": 1442373027.0, "score": 3127, "suggested_sort": null, "gilded": 0, "name": "t3_3l4d84", "selftext_html": null, "title": "This Nasus glitch has lost me so many kills.

Four of us did and we all added each other and went into the game being able to talk to one another. It wasn&amp;#39;t even a contest. It was without a doubt the easiest game of League that I have ever played and the others in my team agreed. The other team couldn&amp;#39;t keep up at all. We simply dominated on every objective, every teamfight, every rotation and why? Because we could work as a TEAM. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not fast enough to type out a lengthy paragraph to my team on why we should concede dragon and just go for objectives.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll time myself right now with this next sentence:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey guys wew don&amp;#39;t have the man power to take dragon or contest properly. We&amp;#39;re too far behind. Our minion waves are pushed up to their turret top though and with such a massive wave they won&amp;#39;t be able to get anything mid or we&amp;#39;ll take their inhib. This way it&amp;#39;s a good trade with no risk and if they play it wrong we get an inhib which is definitely worth.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That took me 35 seconds to write, while taking into account spelling errors and other factors, how long does it take to say? 10 seconds. 10 seconds of me also being able to move my champ around with accuracy and use my spells without tunnel visioning on the map.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This game doesn&amp;#39;t have the potencial to be carried single handedly by 1 person anymore. You SHOULD be matched against those of your own skill level which means you shouldn&amp;#39;t ever be able to pub stomp 5 other people who are the same skill level as you. That simply doesn&amp;#39;t happen, in any Elo. High Elo players get pentas and all that jazz often but no, they can&amp;#39;t go into a game and not rely on their team to do anything and let them 1v5. It won&amp;#39;t happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The thing I don&amp;#39;t understand is that Riot KNOWS these things. The issues are blatantly obvious even at pro-level play. Even those who are payed to play the game have issues in their own teams with communication and THEY&amp;#39;RE ON VOICE CHAT. Can you imagine what if would be like if pros couldn&amp;#39;t talk in their matches but had to type everything and use the limited communication that pinging brings?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t even the big thing though. The big thing is just what the chat means. If I write &amp;quot;just play it safe man&amp;quot; that can come across as being very negative towards a teammate if they don&amp;#39;t understand my inflection. What&amp;#39;s more, the aspect of being able to talk to others makes them human. This is a MAJOR factor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I am in party with others and we&amp;#39;re on Teamspeak and one of my friends screws up, I don&amp;#39;t get angry about it because I can hear them say it themselves. They might go, &amp;quot;Oh dam it I was one second off flash, didn&amp;#39;t know the bush was warded.&amp;quot; That makes me think, &amp;#39;Oh, ok he had the chance to get the kill but he was just a bit unlucky about what happened.&amp;#39; Rather than think, &amp;#39;Omg why didn&amp;#39;t he just run away? they were both so low and Kat can just shunpo for instant damage rather than get in range of Yas&amp;#39; Q.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But what&amp;#39;s more than this is that you get to make friends and the game becomes more enjoyable as a whole. Meeting new people from all over the world, talking during the down times about whatever comes to mind. These are some of the things that make the world of online gaming so appealing and league is completely devoid of this whole facet of online communities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I think back to when I played CoD a few years back, I made friends through voice chat. The banter in games. The ability to really talk and laugh together. Some of the players I added became true friends and now, years later, because of the connection we shared together with our interests and skills I now work for a friend that I made online through CoD.

Personally, I find this aspect of the game to be the single most important change that needs to be made, even over a remade client and certainly over replays. I can&amp;#39;t see a single downside to having chat. Even if people get angry and rage or abuse others you can always just mute them just as you can with Text chat. But holding people back from making close friends, connections that can last for years if not decades. That&amp;#39;s something I can&amp;#39;t excuse. Riot says they&amp;#39;re all about the players, they say that they want League to be an experience for everyone to enjoy, so let that experience be something that I can enjoy outside of the game.

Shy people are shy and accents/different languages are natural, no system in the world would fix that issue.", "ups": 3139, "mod_reports": [], "user_reports": [], "archived": false, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3mog91/this_game_is_so_centered_around_the_notion_of/", "hide_score": false, "author_flair_text": null, "from_kind": null, "from": null, "from_id": null, "distinguished": null, "visited": false, "subreddit": "leagueoflegends", "num_reports": null, "thumbnail": "self", "media_embed": {}, "hidden": false, "stickied": false, "permalink": "/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3mog91/this_game_is_so_centered_around_the_notion_of/", "removal_reason": null, "downs": 0, "likes": null, "created_utc": 1443430678.0, "secure_media_embed": {}}, "kind": "t3"}, {"data": {"banned_by": null, "clicked": false, "over_18": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2rfxx", "approved_by": null, "link_flair_text": null, "quarantine": false, "domain": "self.leagueoflegends", "created": 1442673691.0, "score": 3095, "suggested_sort": null, "gilded": 0, "name": "t3_3lk1b0", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nightblue3, along with the LoL community, has been fundraising for 24h for the NGO &lt;a href=\"http://www.savethechildren.org\"&gt;Save the Children&lt;/a&gt; and raised 30.000$!! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The theme of stream was unranked to diamond.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although he only could reach platinum, many players have benefited from his teachings.

Inspired in part by the slew of Arcade skins that Riot has been releasing, plus my newest hobby of building custom arcade cabinets, a light bulb went off in my head: Why not build a fully functioning (But probably not optimal) League of Legends arcade cabinet? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/w6DWJ\"&gt;So I did.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The end result looked pretty neat, so I figured I&amp;#39;d share with you wonderful people, maybe even inspire some similar ideas. =) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are still some adjustments and polish pieces I&amp;#39;d like to add, including some better ergonomics (I&amp;#39;m a bit tall for this cabinet&amp;#39;s console height, plus right now the console is just a flat board) and supplying this thing with some much better speakers, but overall I&amp;#39;m pretty happy with the outcome for a day or so of work. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: So this kind of totally blew up way more than I expected (This even ended up getting covered by Kotaku?!). But thanks so much for all the love, feedback, and constructive criticism!

Inspired in part by the slew of Arcade skins that Riot has been releasing, plus my newest hobby of building custom arcade cabinets, a light bulb went off in my head: Why not build a fully functioning (But probably not optimal) League of Legends arcade cabinet? \n\n[So I did.](http://imgur.com/a/w6DWJ) \n\nThe end result looked pretty neat, so I figured I'd share with you wonderful people, maybe even inspire some similar ideas. =) \n\nThere are still some adjustments and polish pieces I'd like to add, including some better ergonomics (I'm a bit tall for this cabinet's console height, plus right now the console is just a flat board) and supplying this thing with some much better speakers, but overall I'm pretty happy with the outcome for a day or so of work. \n\n***Edit***: So this kind of totally blew up way more than I expected (This even ended up getting covered by Kotaku?!). But thanks so much for all the love, feedback, and constructive criticism!

Lets note that Yi and Yasuo have the same color and memory trace number from the PROJECT: website.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe something crazy is at play here. There are 2 masks, one of the wolf and one of the lamb. The lamb typically symbolizes innocence, and the wolf typically symbolizes free will, and the leader of the pack. (Yasuo being innocent of a crime he never committed/Yi being described as a leader of the Wuju disciples)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wolves are also known predators to the lamb. This goes with the obsessive Ionian view of balance. Ionia is so intertwined with balance that they have orders/factions devoted to keeping balance. i.e what Shen, Kennen, and Akali belong to. From what we know out of common sense (a Lamb is a young sheep). Sheep typically are animals that need a leader. (The wolf being a great symbol of leadership). Do you see the conflict here?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yasuo is the lone sheep, Innocent of his crimes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yi is the inevitable leader. Always open for a pupil&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But, wait!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now&lt;/strong&gt; at the beginning of Overdrive, you see a scientist, fiddling with Yi. I feel like this scientist is obviously an aged Singed. For starters, Singed generally was the mastermind behind most of the horrific chemical warfare in the Noxus invasion of Ionia. His chemical warfare &lt;strong&gt;led to the altering of memory&lt;/strong&gt; for some and death for many. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quote from Yi&amp;#39;s lore&lt;/strong&gt; - &amp;quot;Those who somehow survived the poisonous concoction had their minds twisted beyond repair.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe this is where Yi loses his actual identity. Yi&amp;#39;s real name is Youmuu. Think about it. The active is basically a miniature Yi ult. I believe that Yi is half ghost/half human. The Active on Youmuus is called &amp;quot;poltergeists ascension&amp;quot;. If you break the meaning of that name down, &lt;strong&gt;it literally means a malevolent spirits rise to an important position or higher level&lt;/strong&gt; (AKA Yi&amp;#39;s rise to leadership)  it would also explain the untargetablility of Yi during alpha strike, if he were a ghost. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is very possible that Yi is the son of an evil spirit and a woman named Reina. Blood moon Akali is said to be inspired by Reina, and Blood moon shen inspired by the evil spirit that haunted her (resemblance of shadow character in the video?? anyone??) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source&lt;/strong&gt;- &lt;a href=\"http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/The_Blood_Moon\"&gt;http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/The_Blood_Moon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Youmuus wiki&lt;/strong&gt;-\n&lt;a href=\"http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Youmuu&amp;#x27;s_Ghostblade\"&gt;http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Youmuu&amp;#39;s_Ghostblade&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What Youmuus was named after (The inspiration)-\n&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Touhou_Project_characters#Youmu_Konpaku\"&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Touhou_Project_characters#Youmu_Konpaku&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, the new champion will probably be the spirit that was haunting Yi&amp;#39;s mother. That would likely make it Yi&amp;#39;s father in some way. It is possible that this demonic being may be a Darkin judging by it&amp;#39;s interest in manipulating human affairs. It&amp;#39;s also possible that this spirit is the originator of Zed&amp;#39;s martial art, which would explain the madness that consumed him and the reason why Zed is hostile towards Yi in overdrive. &lt;em&gt;Judging that he already tried to prove his worth to Shen&amp;#39;s father by defeating Shen&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yasuo would likely be a descendant of Yi, (Ponytails, anyone?) because of his seamless raw power with the wind. It would mean that Yasuo&amp;#39;s master was slain by the evil spirit, Judging that Riven fell victim to Singed&amp;#39;s poison and likely could never pull off such a feat. (Zed assassinated other key leaders before the Noxian invasion)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some of the things PROJECT: Yi says support this even further. Most notably &amp;quot;Demons hide among us&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Face your demon&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yi and Yasuo also share a certain saying..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yasuo: &amp;quot;No one is promised tomorrow&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROJECT: Yi: &amp;quot;Tommorow is no longer your concern&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, there are a few other interesting points but this thread is getting quite long.

It&amp;#39;s not productive, it&amp;#39;s not helping, and being on the receiving end is not &amp;quot;funny&amp;quot;, it&amp;#39;s just being an asshole and expecting everyone else to deal with your bad attitude. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s be real here, the sensitive ones aren&amp;#39;t the people who report, it&amp;#39;s the flamers. I&amp;#39;ve seen so much emotional manipulation trying to justify flaming like &amp;quot;oh he&amp;#39;s just having a bad day&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;League is &lt;em&gt;competitive&lt;/em&gt;, we all get emotional&amp;quot;. Fuck that, we all experience the same emotions, we all go through the same experience. I&amp;#39;m extremely competitive, I have raged and smashed my mouse and let this game get to me waaaay too much. But that&amp;#39;s not toxic, not even a tiny bit, because I don&amp;#39;t bring it into the game or the chat, I keep it to myself because it&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; problem and &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; emotions and &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; responsibility, and my team shouldn&amp;#39;t have to deal with that.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The difference between a healthy player and a toxic one is that the healthy player experiences those emotions, deals with them, but keeps it to themselves.

Deflecting blame from your own issues and expecting everyone else to deal with your problems is just plain immature. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And people will come up with the same &amp;quot;just mute them and stop crying&amp;quot; excuse as if that&amp;#39;s valid too when it&amp;#39;s not. It&amp;#39;s a simple numbers game, instead of shifting the responsibility and blame to the 4 people who have done nothing wrong and who don&amp;#39;t want to listen to one person crying in chat and reducing overall communication and morale (and tilting others in most cases), why not just cut the problem at the root and get the one person causing all the issues to stop talking? I mean the solution is to literally get one person to do NOTHING AT ALL, instead of getting 4 people to deal with his lack of restraint.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have to accept that flamers are the problem, they are the sensitive ones who can&amp;#39;t control themselves and they&amp;#39;re the ones that need to be punished. If you really are so thick skinned, you won&amp;#39;t let this video game get to you and say things you shouldn&amp;#39;t to other people, and as a community we should stop accommodating the minority that are causing all the problems and give genuine consequences for being negative instead of expecting everyone else to deal with it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry if this got a bit long or preachy, I&amp;#39;m just tired of seeing people try to defend flamers and call people crybabies for wanting to play League without being told to kill themsleves.

You have one tutorial which covers the very simple basics of gameplay and mechanics. So much is left unanswered. There are no intermediate tutorials. Here are a few of the questions I had that wasn&amp;#39;t answered in the tutorials, but I felt should have been. I spent a long time googling trying to find these basic answers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Why are items important? (maybe showing no item vs item side by side would help)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;What does the score-screen mean? (in Counter-Strike the best performing player is at the top, but in League the player order seems random. No idea if you did well or not, especially vs supports. Hard to tell what is deaths, kills, vs assists at first)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Why do ADCs go bot, Melee go top, etc? Who determines this?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Wth is jungle? Why do I need smite?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;And many more...&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think the basics of the meta should at least be covered and especially dissecting the score screen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Champion Pool&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You start with the basic champs until level 6, and then you get to enter the champ rotation. By level 6, I have enough IP to buy one low level champ if I would like, or play with the rotation until you found a champ you liked. I think this works well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many people are talking about having access to all the champs, etc, but few of us new players care about that. We just want to find ONE that is fun to play to see if the game is worth playing at all. Does the champion have a lot of options? Is there room for creative play? Or is this a 1a2a3a game (excuse my Starcraft lingo)?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Limiting choice for new players is actually a good thing, because there are just so many other factors that we are still learning, including match-up dynamics, working as a team, and why last hitting minions is important (which is still unintuitive to me btw, i think you should get a portion of gold for damage dealt).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A new Pokemon player has no need to catch all 150 Pokemon. They just want to get the starter pokemon that&amp;#39;s right for them. A new League player doesn&amp;#39;t want all the champs. We just want to get the champ that is right for us. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Player Vs Player + Smurfs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we jumped right into PvP, because who the hell wants to play bots. And starting out, people are actually worse than the bots. They have slower reaction times and are super aggressive. After winning a slew of our first few games, we started getting an itch to play ranked, but a string of losses reminds us that we&amp;#39;re still leveling up for a reason, and just playing to have fun. &lt;em&gt;Note: I do admit that this leveling process is a lot easier with friends. If I was by myself I would definitely want to jump into ranked right away.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for smurfs... how much it matters really depends on the person. I&amp;#39;ve only encountered maybe 5 smurfs, but you can tell when they are (Many people claim to be smurfs but are really bad). They move different. They have different patterns of aggression. They bait you with fake recalls, getting you to go in and then jungler ganks you. I actually really enjoy playing smurfs, as it exposes me to higher levels of play, making me realize what options are actually safe and others that actually aren&amp;#39;t. My buddy, however, doesn&amp;#39;t. He doesn&amp;#39;t care about getting better at this game, he just cares about having a good time for an hour before he has to go do something else, which is also perfectly valid. In the end this is personal preference.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rune Pages and Masteries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember when I said limiting choice was a good thing for new players? What if when you started the game all this crap was thrown at you, and then included Runes and Masteries? We didn&amp;#39;t even know what these pages did until level 10, when a buddy who has played way more League mentioned that I should set these up. And besides, at our level, not having 4% Ability Power at level 18 isn&amp;#39;t the thing that is losing us games. Trying to tower dive is losing us games. Going for baron too early is losing us games. Enemy Heimerdingers and Garens are losing us games. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rune pages and Masteries are a fun mechanic that make leveling up worth it, along with the IP we receive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a new player who is going through this process with a group of friends, these are the things we care about. I think for the most part, the 1-30 system works well, though maybe could be shortened to 1-20. The tutorials should be better, and have optional ones that go more in-depth. As for champion pool, maybe a sandbox mode (huehue) would help in this regard, especially for displaying the efficacy of items.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But for all the people kicking and screaming saying that they NEED more champs, free rune pages, masteries, etc, maybe you&amp;#39;ve been sucked in by the free-to-play business model and it&amp;#39;s just working as intended?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: New players don&amp;#39;t care about the same things you do, person who has spent money on this game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit:\nThanks for all the thoughts!

Koreans are notorious for grinding solo queue as well as taking it more seriously. We even have Chinese players playing on the Korean server for a more competitive solo queue experience. It can definitely be argued that as a whole, both regions are much more mechanically gifted than NA.

While some of you may think we don\u2019t listen to people with no game design experience telling us how to balance our own game, we do take that into consideration.
